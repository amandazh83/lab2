        <div class="panel">
            <p> Harry Potter, who was raised by his uncle's family, endured years of
                discrimination and bullying. However, on his 11th birthday, he discovered
                that he was, in fact, a wizard and had been accepted into Hogwarts School
                of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Boarding the Hogwarts Express, Harry embarked
                on a magical journey full of wonder and surprises. At Hogwarts, he made his
                first true friends: Ron and Hermione. He also dove into fascinating magical
                subjects, including flying lessons, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Potions,
                and Transfiguration, not to mention the thrilling game of Quidditch that
                captivates every wizard.</p>
            <p> On the other hand, Professor Snape, the Potions master, seemed to harbor an
                unfriendly attitude toward Harry. Meanwhile, Harry accidentally stumbled
                upon the secret of the Philosopher’s Stone. As dark schemes began to quietly
                grow in the seemingly peaceful halls of Hogwarts, Harry, Ron, and Hermione
                decided to investigate. With their courage and wit, Harry ultimately thwarted
                the evil plot and protected the Philosopher’s Stone. In the process, he also
                faced his arch-enemy, Voldemort, for the very first time.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p> Harry Potter was trapped at his aunt's house, but luckily, Ron came to
            his rescue just in time, allowing Harry to spend the rest of the summer
            happily at the Weasleys' home. However, the house-elf Dobby tried to warn
            Harry and used every means to prevent him from returning to school. When
            Harry and Ron were locked out of the platform, they had no choice but to
            fly a car back to Hogwarts.</p>
        <p> The legendary Chamber of Secrets was opened by the heir of Slytherin, and
            Harry, due to his ability to speak Parseltongue, became the target of
            suspicion. Harry discovered a mysterious diary that contained Tom Riddle's
            memories from 50 years ago, and soon a series of terrifying attacks disrupted
            the once-peaceful campus. Ron's sister, Ginny, was taken into the Chamber,
            leaving a bloody warning on the walls. With Hogwarts facing the threat of
            closure, Harry and his friends had to act quickly to uncover the truth.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p> Harry Potter reluctantly spent his summer vacation at his aunt's house,
            completely cut off from the wizarding world. The letters from Ron and
            Hermione were his only solace. During a visit from Aunt Marge, Harry
            lost his temper after enduring her insults about his parents and
            accidentally inflated her like a giant balloon. Fearing punishment,
            Harry fled into the night, embarking on a new adventure.</p>
        <p> In his panic, Harry saw a large black dog, a known omen of death
            in the wizarding world. On the train ride back to school, Harry
            encountered the legendary Dementors, which surrounded him with
            terrifying sensations. At school, he saw the ominous black dog
            again and soon learned the truth about his parents' death, blaming
            it all on Sirius Black. Determined to seek revenge, Harry resolved
            to confront him.</p>
        <p> Professor Lupin taught Harry the magic to ward off Dementors, and
            with the help of the Marauder's Map, Harry finally found Sirius in
            the Shrieking Shack. Sirius pointed his wand at Ron's pet rat,
            Scabbers, and as Scabbers transformed into human form, Sirius
            revealed the truth about what had happened. Just as Sirius was
            about to clear his name, Snape intervened and ruined everything.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p> One summer night, Harry Potter was abruptly awakened by a sharp pain
            in his scar. He had a strange dream that left him deeply worried. Not
            long after, during the Quidditch World Cup, a terrifying event
            occurred—the Dark Mark of the evil wizard, who had disappeared
            thirteen years ago, appeared in the sky.</p>
        <p> Hogwarts hosted a grand event in the wizarding world: the "Triwizard Tournament."
            Through dark magic, the evil wizard ensured that Harry, though underage, was chosen
            as the fourth competitor. With the help of his friends Hermione and Ron, Harry
            successfully completed the three tasks. However, when Harry and his fellow competitor
            Cedric lifted the Triwizard Cup in celebration, the nightmare had only just begun.
            The Cup was a Portkey that transported them to a graveyard. There, Cedric was killed
            by Wormtail, and Voldemort, who had been hidden in a snake-like form for thirteen
            years, was resurrected using Harry's blood.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p> During a long summer holiday, Harry Potter was stuck at 4 Privet
            Drive, where he unexpectedly encountered a Dementor attack. He was
            aware that Dumbledore and members of the Order of the Phoenix
            were intensifying their secret efforts to counter the growing power
            of Voldemort. However, no one was willing to share more details with
            him.</p>
        <p> Frustrated and angry, Harry returned to Hogwarts, only to find that
            Dumbledore was avoiding him, and Hagrid was nowhere to be found.
            To make matters worse, Harry began to have recurring dreams of a
            long corridor. Every time he approached the door at the end of the
            corridor, he would wake up in excruciating pain, feeling as though
            a snake was writhing inside him. The shadow of a serpent grew
            increasingly vivid in Harry's mind, signaling Voldemort's encroaching
            presence. It was then that Dumbledore revealed a monumental secret
            to Harry.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p> As the new school year was about to begin, Professor Dumbledore
            unexpectedly arrived at the Dursleys' home to fetch Harry Potter,
            marking an unusual start to Harry's sixth year. Even more surprising
            events soon followed—Harry discovered an old Potions textbook in the
            classroom cupboard. Its previous owner, "The Half-Blood Prince,"
            provided notes and instructions that turned Harry into a Potions
            prodigy.</p>
        <p> Dumbledore began private lessons with Harry, guiding him through
            a series of harrowing memories about Voldemort’s youth, unraveling
            the mystery of his extraordinary origins. Together, Dumbledore and
            Harry set out to locate one of Voldemort’s Horcruxes, venturing
            into a distant cave where Dumbledore drank a mysterious poison
            to retrieve it.</p>
        <p> Upon their return to Hogwarts, the Dark Mark loomed ominously
            above the castle. On the tower, Snape cast the Killing Curse at
            Dumbledore, sending him falling to his death as the phoenix sang
            a mournful requiem. After the funeral, Harry resolved to fulfill
            Dumbledore's final wish: to find and destroy the remaining
            Horcruxes.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>With only four days until his seventeenth birthday, when he would
            officially become a wizard, Harry Potter was forced to leave 4
            Privet Drive early, bidding farewell to the place he had called
            home for sixteen years.</p>
        <p>The Order of the Phoenix devised a carefully planned operation to
            secretly relocate Harry, protecting him from Voldemort and his
            Death Eaters. However, their plans went awry when they were
            ambushed. Meanwhile, Voldemort had already seized control of
            Hogwarts, taken over the Ministry of Magic, and dominated half
            the wizarding world, plunging it into chaos. Accompanied by Ron
            and Hermione, Harry went into hiding, constantly on the run.
            While working to fulfill Dumbledore's final mission of destroying
            Voldemort's Horcruxes, Harry learned of the legendary Deathly
            Hallows and the possibility that possessing all three could
            guarantee Voldemort's defeat. However, Voldemort had also begun
            his hunt for the Elder Wand, sending his Death Eaters to track
            down Harry and set a deadly trap.</p>
